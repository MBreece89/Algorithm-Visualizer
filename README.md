## 🖥️ Run Locally
Clone and serve the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-visualizer.git
cd algorithm-visualizer

# Run with Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Or with Node.js
npx http-server
⚠️ Note: ES6 modules require serving via HTTP. Opening index.html directly may cause import errors.

🧑‍💻 Example Problems
Sliding Window → Maximum sum subarray

Two Pointers → Find pair with target sum

Stack → Next Greater Element

Linked List → Reverse a linked list

Recursion → Fibonacci sequence visualization

🎯 How to Use
Select an algorithm or problem from the dropdown.

Click Run Algorithm (for built-ins) or Run My Code (for your solution).

Watch the visualization animate step-by-step with highlights and explanations.

Debug, tweak, and improve your code visually.
